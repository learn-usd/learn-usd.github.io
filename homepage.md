Welcome to **OpenUSD in One Weekend** â€” your gateway to mastering Universal Scene Description (USD), the industry-standard framework revolutionizing 3D content creation and collaboration.

## What You'll Learn

This book series is designed as a practical, weekend-intensive journey through OpenUSD. Whether you're a 3D artist, technical director, software developer, or curious enthusiast, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- **Core USD Concepts**: Stages, layers, prims, and the fundamental building blocks of USD scenes
- **Python Scripting**: Programmatic creation and manipulation of USD files using Python APIs
- **Asset Management**: Building modular, reusable 3D assets and complex scene hierarchies
- **Animation & Dynamics**: Creating time-varying data, animations, and physics simulations
- **Advanced Workflows**: Multi-layered compositions, variants, and collaborative pipelines
- **Real-World Applications**: From digital twins to metaverse content creation

This book focuses on **Python scripting** with OpenUSD rather than GUI-based workflows. You'll learn to harness the full programmatic power of USD, enabling automation, customization, and scalable 3D production pipelines.

This book is designed to be accessible and inclusive for learners at all levels:

- **Plain-language explanations** with step-by-step guidance
- **Screen-reader friendly** structure with semantic headings and alt text
- **Copy-pasteable code** and fully runnable scripts
- **Minimal setup** using `pip` or `conda` or `Python in Blender`; no proprietary tools required
- **Cross-platform parity**: the same exercises and scripts work on all major OSes

## Why OpenUSD Matters

OpenUSD isn't just another 3D file format â€” it's a comprehensive ecosystem designed for the future of 3D content. Originally developed by Pixar and now stewarded by the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD), USD has become the foundation for:

- **Film & Animation**: Major studios use USD for complex production pipelines
- **Games & Interactive Media**: Real-time engines leverage USD for asset streaming
- **Industrial Metaverse**: Manufacturing and simulation workflows built on USD
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Training datasets and synthetic content generation

## Book Structure

This series is organized as a progressive weekend learning experience:

**Before We Begin** ðŸŽ¨
: Get inspired by Andy's artistic USD creations, understand the USD ecosystem, and set up your development environment

**Day One** âš¡
: Master the fundamentals â€” create your first USD files, understand scene composition, and build reusable assets

**Day Two** ðŸš€  
: Dive into advanced topics â€” animation, physics simulation, complex scene assembly, and optimization techniques

**After the Weekend** ðŸŒŸ
: Explore cutting-edge applications, integration with modern tools, and prepare for production workflows

## Who This Book Is For

- **3D Artists** transitioning to code-driven workflows
- **Technical Directors** building USD-based pipelines  
- **Software Developers** entering the 3D graphics domain
- **Researchers** working with synthetic datasets and simulations
- **Students** learning modern 3D content creation technologies

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with 3D concepts (geometry, transformations, materials)
- Willingness to learn through hands-on coding




Tested on recent versions of macOS, Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distributions, and Windows 10/11.
